The goal of this repo is to document the cloudron service for Chaco.

Long term the plan is to host cloudron on premises but for the purposes of testing a test server was set-up on Ubuntu 20.04 as follows, based on instructions from [Hetzner](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-hcloud-cli):

```{r, engine='bash'}
gh repo create chapeltowncohousing/cloud # create the repo with GitHub's CLI tool
sudo apt install hcloud # install hetzner cloud CLI tool
hcloud context create chaco # message: Context chaco created and activated
```

```{r, engine='bash', eval=TRUE}
hcloud context list
```
