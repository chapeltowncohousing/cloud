<!-- Long term the plan is to host cloudron on premises but for the purposes of testing a test server was set-up on Ubuntu 20.04 as follows, based on instructions from [Hetzner](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-hcloud-cli): 

```{r, engine='bash'}
gh repo create chapeltowncohousing/cloud # create the repo with GitHub's CLI tool
sudo apt install hcloud # install hetzner cloud CLI tool
hcloud context create chaco # message: Context chaco created and activated
```


```{r, engine='bash'}
hcloud context list
```

```{r, engine='bash'}
hcloud server-type list
```

Launch the server as follows:

```{r, engine='bash'}
hcloud server create --image ubuntu-20.04 --type cx41 --name chaco
```
